### Hi there 👋

> 🤖 Thanks for visiting my github profile! My name is Joe Sangiorgio and I'm currently a Senior Engineering Manager at iCIMS. I have a passion for all things Javascript, and love creating meaningful data-driven web applications (either directly or indirectly). In recent years I've also garnered an interest in fostering powerful engineering teams that can effectively build this type of software. 🦾

- 👨‍💻 I’m looking to contribute via paid work on front-end or full-stack applications that allow flexible hours
- 📫 How to reach me: [Contact Me Here](https://www.joesangiorgio.com/Contact)
- 🙂 Pronouns: He/Him
- 🐷 Fun fact: I have a pet guinea pig named Graham. We both love apples 🍎

```Have a great day! 🏂```
